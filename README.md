# Oddball

The Oddball is a split mechanical keyboard with an integrated trackball. While drawing inspiration from things like the [Jian](https://github.com/KGOH/Jian-Info) and the [Dactyl Manuform](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform), it is instead designed with a switch plate and PCB to give it durability, replicability, and a more utilitarian look. It has a relatively minimal key layout, typically with 39 keys in total. The PCB is reversible so it can be built with 0, 1 or theoretically 2 trackballs. Due to the height and angle of the optical sensor, and as an ergonomic bonus, it requires a tented case.
